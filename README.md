This project implements an advanced data compression system inspired by the PAQ family of compressors. It features multiple reversible transformations, prime-based XOR encoding, bitwise pattern inversions, and sophisticated state management to improve compression efficiency and accuracy.

The system is designed to:
	•	Compress and decompress data efficiently using layered transformations.
	•	Employ custom reversible transformations (XOR with primes, bit inversion).
	•	Use state tables for bitwise modeling inspired by PAQ compressors.
	•	Support buffered data handling and flexible memory management.
	•	Provide a basis for experimenting with adaptive compression algorithms.

Key Features
	•	Reversible transformations: Multiple strategies including XOR with prime numbers and bit inversion for preprocessing data to improve compressibility.
	•	Efficient buffering: Circular buffer implementation for reading/writing data in blocks optimized for compression.
	•	State modeling: A comprehensive state table mimics the adaptive modeling of PAQ compressors for accurate probability estimation.
	•	Helper utilities: Bitwise logarithm, squashing/stretching functions for mapping data ranges efficiently.
	•	Modular design: Separate classes for string handling, array management, and buffering, allowing extensibility.

Usage

The project can be integrated into compression pipelines or extended to support more advanced models:
	1.	Compression: Data is first transformed using reversible transformations to enhance compressibility.
	2.	Modeling: Transformed data is processed through state tables that guide probability estimation.
	3.	PAQ Compression: The final compressed output is generated by the PAQ engine (to be integrated).

Example:

Original int	11234567
To bytes	b'\xab\x6f\x8f'
XOR 3rd byte	b'\xab\x6f\x8a'
Invert bits	b'\x54\x90\x75'
Invert again	b'\xab\x6f\x8a'
XOR again	b'\xab\x6f\x8f'
Back to int	11234567

I have added minus from the table.
